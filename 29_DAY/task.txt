Coding Tasks (Mandatory)
✅ Task 1: Race Condition Example
Without synchronization:
2 threads deposit ₹1000 each
Expected balance = 2000
Result may be incorrect → observe issue

✅ Task 2: Solve Using Synchronized Method
Same code using:
synchronized void deposit()
Now output correct hoga.

✅ Task 3: Synchronized Block
Make:
synchronized(obj) { ... }
Perform withdraw/deposit.

✅ Task 4: Producer–Consumer (wait/notify)
Simple version:
Producer → value = value + 1
Consumer → print value
Use wait() and notify()

✅ Task 5: Deadlock Example
Two locks:
String lock1 = "A";
String lock2 = "B";
Thread-1 lock1 → lock2
Thread-2 lock2 → lock1
Observe freeze.
